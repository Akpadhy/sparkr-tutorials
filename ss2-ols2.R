## Social Science Methodologies: Generalized Linear Models (GLM) Module 2 ##
############################################################################
## Objective: 
## Operations discussed: glm

library(SparkR)

## Initiate SparkContext:

sc <- sparkR.init(sparkEnvir=list(spark.executor.memory="2g", 
                                  spark.driver.memory="1g",
                                  spark.driver.maxResultSize="1g")
                  ,sparkPackages="com.databricks:spark-csv_2.11:1.4.0") # Load CSV Spark Package

## AWS EMR is using Spark 2.11 so we need the associated version of spark-csv: http://spark-packages.org/package/databricks/spark-csv
## Define Spark executor memory, as well as driver memory and maxResultSize according to cluster configuration

## Initiate SparkRSQL:

sqlContext <- sparkRSQL.init(sc)

## Read in loan performance example data as DataFrame (DF) 'dat':

dat <- read.df(sqlContext, "s3://sparkr-tutorials/hfpc_ex", header='false', inferSchema='true')
cache(dat)
columns(dat)
## > columns(dat)
##  [1] "loan_id"       "period"        "servicer_name" "new_int_rt"    "act_endg_upb"  "loan_age"     
##  [7] "mths_remng"    "aj_mths_remng" "dt_matr"       "cd_msa"        "delq_sts"      "flag_mod"     
## [13] "cd_zero_bal"   "dt_zero_bal" 

## 'loan_id' (Loan Identifier): A unique identifier for the mortgage loan
## 'period' (Monthly Reporting Period): The month and year that pertain to the servicerâ€™s cut-off period for mortgage loan information
## 'servicer_name' (Servicer Name): the name of the entity that serves as the primary servicer of the mortgage loan
## 'new_int_rt' (Current Interest Rate): The interest rate on a mortgage loan in effect for the periodic installment due
## 'act_endg_upb' (Current Actual Unpaid Principal Balance (UPB)): The actual outstanding unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loan (for liquidated loans, the unpaid
## principal balance of the mortgage loan at the time of liquidation)
## 'loan_age' (Loan Age): The number of calendar months since the first full month the mortgage loan accrues interest
## 'mths_remng' (Remaining Months to Maturity): The number of calendar months remaining until the borrower is expected to pay the mortgage loan in full 
## 'aj_mths_remng' (Adjusted Remaining Months To Maturity): the number of calendar months remaining until the borrower is expected to pay the mortgage loan in full
## 'dt_matr' (Maturity Date): The month and year in which a mortgage loan is scheduled to be paid in full as defined in the mortgage loan documents
## 'cd_msa' (Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)): The numeric Metropolitan Statistical Area Code for the property securing the mortgage loan
## 'delq_sts' (Current Loan Delinquent Status): The number of days, represented in months, the obligor is delinquent as determined by the governing mortgage documents
## 'flag_mod' (Modification Flag): An indicator that denotes if the mortgage loan has been modified
## 'cd_zero_bal' (Zero Balance Code): A code indicating the reason the mortgage loan's balance was reduced to zero
## 'dt_zero_bal' (Zero Balance Effective Date): Date on which the mortgage loan balance was reduced to zero

## Print the schema for the DF to see if the data types specifications in the schema make sense, given the variable descriptions above:

# Cast each of the columns noted above into the correct dtype before proceeding with specifying glms
